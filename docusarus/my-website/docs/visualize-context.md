## Visualize and understand context.

DBF collects context data from various sources such as Open Street Maps, Google Places, FourSquare, Mapbox, etc. and juxtaposes it in a appealing 3D environment, allowing users to explore and reveal nuanced characteristics and relationships, thus making informed and calculated design decisions.

### Filter through various aspects of the context in 3D and 2D, through different modes such as sustainability, program and form. Understand the context and make informed design decisions.

> DBF tool collects data about neighbouring buildings, businesses, roads and transport networks, terrain and so on, and populates this data in a user-friendly 3D scene for you to visualize and play with.

Use the 'M' button to toggle between various modes of visualization.
