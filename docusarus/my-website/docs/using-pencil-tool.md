## Like pen & paper, but better.

Use the pencil tool to demarcate roads, parks and so on. Freehand drawing will yield organic and unexpected shapes. Use the pencil tool to measure aspects of design such as dimensions and walking distances.

### Use the DBF Pencil tool to draw over the site and affect designs. Create organic shapes and unexpected designs.

> The pencil allows to draw directly over the site and design, either as polyline or freehand.

Pencil tool works very well in top view, so switch to plan view to draw directly over the site.
