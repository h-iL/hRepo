> DBF tool collects data about neighbouring buildings, businesses, roads and transport networks, terrain and so on, and populates this data in a user-friendly 3D scene for you to visualize and play with.

Use the polygon tool or the rectangle tool to demarcate your site. Upon confirming, DBF searches for your site and contextual data in 500m radius of your site in real time and loads it onto the DBF tool in 3D format.
