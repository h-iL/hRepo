## Sun, wind, water & earth.

Sustainability is at the core of DBF. Harness the power of DBF sustainability tools to create meaningful and responsible designs.

### Visualize sun paths, shadows, windrose and terrain. Perform radiation analysis to create informed sustainable designs.

> DBF tool allows users to perform quick rule of thumb sustainability analysis to get a gauge of how well the generated design performs.

Visualize the sun path and sun position at any time of the year, specific to your latitude and longitude. Overlay the windrose diagram generated from weather stations nearest to the site to understand wind speeds and directions throughout the year.

Perform fast heuristic radiation analysis to get a guage of how your design affects the site and vice versa.
